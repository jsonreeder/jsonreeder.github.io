## Jason _Who?_

I'm a developer, linguist, and punslinger based out of SF. I build websites using Ruby on Rails, React, PostgreSQL, and Sass. I script in Ruby and Python. I write in Spacemacs and VS Code. I'm from Oakland, but have called a number of other cities home, including Cairo, Tangier, Amman, and Los Mochis. Ask me about living in plain text, Arabic linguistics, mindfulness, or bluegrass guitar.
